# 👋 Hey, I'm Arpan Neupane

🚀 A full-stack developer focused on building real-world applications that solve problems — not just tutorials or to-do lists.

🛠️ I specialize in:
- **Backend**: Django, Express.js, Node.js
- **Frontend**: React.js (with clean design principles)
- **Databases**: SQLite, MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Session-based systems, secure forms
- **Verification Systems**: Real-time document & image validation

## 💼 Projects That Reflect My Work Ethic

- 🎯 **Document Verification System**  
  Real-time image capture, license & citizenship form validation, admin panel with CSV export — built from backend to frontend.

- 🧭 **Portfolio + Admin Dashboard**  
  A dynamic portfolio with an editable backend — clients or I can update content without touching code.

- 📚 **Learning Tracker Dashboard** *(WIP)*  
  A personal dashboard to track skills I'm learning — React, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## 🌱 Currently Growing In
